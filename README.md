discrete_math_study_notes
=========================

These are my study notes on the book "Discrete Math from Discrete Mathematics and its Applications with Combinatorics and Graph Theory" by Kenneth Rosen. Vol 7. (Special Indian Edition). I will also add study notes from other books which aid in my comprehension of the topic.

Due to the importance of mathematics in creating algorithms and data structures, it is essential to learn discrete mathematics. I am using "Discrete Math from Discrete Mathematics and its Applications with Combinatorics and Graph Theory" by Rosen. Vol 7 to learn the material. There are other notes online which I will use as well and will add them as seperate files. 

There are many coding bootcamps teaching the basics of how to code, but the nitty gritty lays in learning the math.  Hopefully, this can be a good resource for you to study from and along with. There are many resources to learn math, however, there isn't a great place to learn discrete math in a easy to grasp format for beginners, and those who are afraid or believe they are not good at math. Take it from me, it is just a matter of practice.

Please, feel free to look at the examples and contribute to the answers and explinations behind them. If there are any wrong ones, please correct them at your lesiure. Hopefully, together we can bootstrap a great tool to aid programmers and codenewbies to get to the next level. It is my desire to get enough people contributing to this project so that we can completely revise the questions from the copyrighted book above into something orignal, free and open source.
